- Keep the implementations simple, no need to over-engineer things
- Prioritize extensibility and maintainability, so that when we decide to add new functionality, nothing will break
- Test newly deployed functionality with mock data (only when the base is built)
- Simplicity is priority, avoid unnecessary code 
- Keep the code clean, reusable and self-explanatory, add comments only for non-obvious parts, excessive comments are discouraged
- When multiple different in implementation but similar in approach piece of codes are used, decompose them in separate files, unless original implementation is meant to be in a single file 
- Check that your new changes do not break existing functionality
- Avoid flooding the repo with .md files, no need for documentation that is not asked for.
